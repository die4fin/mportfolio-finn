**FINDIT Core** is a cutting-edge, AI-powered draft simulation and analysis tool designed for Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) competitive esports. Developed by **InFinnity Labs**, this application bridges the gap between raw statistical data and actionable tactical execution.

By leveraging an XGBoost Machine Learning model and a highly interactive, cinematic frontend, FINDIT processes draft telemetry (Picks and Bans) in real-time to forecast win probabilities and generate dynamic, situation-specific strategic insights.

## ✨ Core Features

* 🌍 **Global Cross-Region Matchups:** Simulate drafts between top-tier professional teams across multiple global regions (MPL ID, MPL PH, MPL MY, MENA, CIS, etc.) with real-time FlagCDN integration.
* 🧠 **AI-Driven Telemetry:** Powered by a Python-based Machine Learning backend hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, utilizing historical draft data to predict match outcomes with high precision.
* 📊 **Dynamic Tactical Insights:** Generates context-aware, UK English tactical recommendations and insights based on the mathematical margin of the draft probability.
* 🎨 **Premium Glassmorphism UI:** An "Apple-style" minimalist aesthetic featuring frosted glass panels, glowing accent telemetry, and seamless 60fps animations powered by Framer Motion.
* 🔄 **Cinematic Reboot Sequence:** A highly immersive loading state that simulates an AI core boot-up sequence during matchup configuration.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v18.x or later)
* Git

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/findit-draft-sim.git](https://github.com/yourusername/findit-draft-sim.git)
    cd findit-draft-sim/frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Open the application:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your preferred browser.

> **Note:** The frontend is configured to automatically communicate with the production Hugging Face AI backend. No local Python setup is strictly required to run the UI, unless modifying the ML model.

## 📂 Project Structure Highlights

* `/app/components`: Contains the modular UI components (`TeamSelector`, `HeroGrid`, `DraftSlot`, etc.).
* `/app/constants`: Houses the static database for global `teams.ts` and `heroes.ts`.
* `/app/simulator`: The main simulation engine and state manager for the Pick & Ban flow.
